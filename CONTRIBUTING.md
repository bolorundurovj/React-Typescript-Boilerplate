# Contributing to React JavaScript Boilerplate

Thank you for your interest in contributing to React JavaScript Boilerplate! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here are the main ways you can contribute:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Report bugs and issues
- üí° **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features and improvements
- üìù **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- üîß **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests with code changes
- üß™ **Testing**: Help improve test coverage
- üåü **Star the Repository**: Show your support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Yarn 1.22.0 or higher
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub first, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/React-Javascript-Boilerplate.git
   cd React-Javascript-Boilerplate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Check code quality
yarn lint
yarn format:check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
yarn lint:fix
yarn format
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add new button component"
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new features"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for Button component"

# Avoid these
git commit -m "updated stuff"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "wip"
```

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Clear title and description
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Test results

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let` and `var`
- Use arrow functions for consistency
- Use destructuring when possible
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design patterns
- Ensure responsive design
- Maintain accessibility standards

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run tests with UI
yarn test:ui

# Generate coverage report
yarn test:coverage

# Run tests once
yarn test:run
```

### Writing Tests

- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Test error states
- Test accessibility features
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test rendering
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', () => {
    // Test interactions
  });

  it('should handle error states', () => {
    // Test error handling
  });
});
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### README Updates

- Keep installation instructions up to date
- Document new features
- Update examples and code snippets
- Maintain clear project structure

### Code Comments

- Add comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
